## A Paragraph about your computer experience. Include your undergrad major, any computer courses you've taken, any programs you've written, and any projects you've collaborated on.
I have done web development work, data science, and Java-based back-end work while studying at SUNY New Paltz. I started coding in 10th grade, I worked with HTML css, and Bootstrap and have been working with those languages and tools for many years now, I have taught web development to high school students as well. I have taught a total of 120 students html css and bootstrap with a little bit of javascript. This URL is my online resume which has work that dates back to my time in high school.

## A Paragraph about how you see yourself using what we learn in this course
I see myself strengthening my confidence in web development work. These past few years I have mainly focused on working with data science. But deep down I know that I enjoy creating web applications more than breaking down data with R or Python. I want to be challenged by this course since this is my senior year I need to graduate with an internship or a job position. I can't rely on my parent help for much longer.
